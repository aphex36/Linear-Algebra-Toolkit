# Linear-Algebra-Toolkit

This project was for the purpose of adding an interface to calculate Matrix options and decompositions calculated constantly during linear algebra courses.

It adds an interface to numeric.js's methods but I extended the methods to include other decomposition methods such as QR Decomposition, Reduced Row Echelon Form, Rank/Nullity, Determinant, and Cholesky Factorization
